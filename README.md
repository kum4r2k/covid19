# Analysing COVID-19 pandemic in India using python

I have included the dataset used, it was updated to 7th August 2020. This is a small project, it is not maintained regularly. It does show some patterns in the cases, deaths and other factors using the dataset compiled. I am listing the various sources below.

    1. COVID-19 cases, deaths and cured/discharged data as of August 7th, 2020 “https://www.mygov.in/corona-data/covid19-statewise-status/”
    2. Population of Indian states as reported in the 2011 census http://statisticstimes.com/demographics/population-of-indian-states.php
    3. Literacy rate of Indian states https://www.jagranjosh.com/general-knowledge/literacy-rate-among-the-indian-states-census-2011-1476094746-1

    5. Healthcare expenditure of major states in India https://www.statista.com/statistics/685200/india-highest-public-health-expenditure-by-state/
